	•	Implement a lightbox or modal to view larger versions of images

	•	Add hover animations or entrance effects using CSS or a JS library
	•	Add captions or metadata (date, camera info) for each image

If you like, I can **generate a screenshot mockup** of your gallery (desktop + mobile) so you can save it into `image1.png` and have a polished preview in your README. Would you like me to do that?
